# hello-world
My first project on GitHub!

About Me: I'm the type of person who once starts something has to finish it. I'm very interpersonal and care the well-being of others. I always put others above myself in alot of situations. That could be a great strength or devastating weakness. I'm always excited to meet new people and learn new ideas.
